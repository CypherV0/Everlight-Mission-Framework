*Please read these instructions carefully!*
DO NOT edit the comms.sqf or the roster.sqf files. You will find instructions on what to do with them listed below.

Step 1- In a code editor such as Notepad++ (not regular notepad), open and edit the briefing file you intend to use 
for the given side. 
NOTE: We are almost always Blufor, regardless of faction, but you may find a need to have players on both Blufor and Indfor and give 
them separate info. In that case, you'd edit the Blufor and the Indfor briefing files.

IF USING INDFOR: a- In the mission editor, load the mission and access the briefing settings (top of the screen, click TMF -> Briefing Settings).
		 b- Choose "Add Briefing", and in the dialog that opens, you will see Briefing Name and Script Location. 
		 c- Name it "BriefingIndfor". Then for the script location enter "briefing\briefing_indfor.sqf" and click OKAY.
		 d- On the Briefing Settings page, select the Indfor Briefing you just created, then to the right under "Those to be briefed", 
		    you will select the Indfor side and click GRANT. You should see a green check to the right of Indfor. 
		 e- Repeat step "d" but for the Comms and Roster pages (don't make more, just use the ones that are there).

Step 2- TEST IT! You must test that your briefing works by previewing it in the editor, and then on our dedicated server.

Done!
