# Everlight-Mission-Framework

To use this template:

- Download (click the green Code dropdown, choose "download ZIP")
- Unzip the Everlight-Mission-Framework-main.zip folder and open it
- Inside you will find the Everlight_Mission_Framework folder, a launcher preset file, and a README file.
- Place the Everlight_Mission_Framework folder in your MPMissions folder, located in Documents\Arma 3 - Other Profiles\*YourProfileName*
- If you do not have an MPMissions folder for some reason, go to that location, create a new folder called MPMissions, done.
- After you've place the Everlight_Mission_Framework folder in your MPMissions folder, load it up in the in-game editor.
NOTE: Any time you plan to edit missions, please use the Editor mod preset which I've conveniently uploaded here for you, which will not create any invalid dependencies in the mission file.
To import a mod preset, open your launcher and go to the Mods tab. Then click Presets, followed by Import, and choose the Editor file.
